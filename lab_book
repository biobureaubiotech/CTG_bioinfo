Today I've done the BLAST of all 60717 L. fortunei proteins predicted in the genome against A. gambiae proteins related to fertility publishe
in a Nature Biotechnology paper (Hammond et al., 2016 doi:10.1038/nbt.3439 ) 

Database was all the protein sequences present at Supplementary Table 5 of the above paper, although 4 sequences listed on Table 5 was not
present on the genome of A. gambiae downloaded from the Esembl browser, nor were find went specificaly searched on the Esembl website.
Those not found sequences are: AGAP011235-PA, AGAP010915-PA, AGAP007997-PA, AGAP012170-PA.

First local BLAST results are at biobureau gdrive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B2pYU5fjrq3EczhILWRyWDBTa3M

Organizing all the BLASTs to find the fertility genes in L. fortunei. We are using the genes employed by Crisanti 

blastp -query Anopheles_gambiae.AgamP4.pep.crisanti.fasta -db /home/ubuntu/nr -evalue 1e-05 -num_threads 4 -out Anopheles_gambiae.AgamP4.pep.crisanti.fasta.blast-NR.1e05 &


1-) Another BLAST from today: L. fortunei proteins against molluscan reproduction genes Ju_Americo have choosen.

makeblastdb -in mollusca.rep.fa -dbtype prot
blastp -query marcela.fasta -db molluscan_genes/mollusca.rep.fa -evalue 1e-05 -num_threads 4 -out marcela.mollusca.rep.fa1e05 &

-BLASTing all reproduction mollucans mRNA and proteins against marcela.fasta
I'm doing this in Amazon, in the isntance called CTG_BLAST 
 blastp -query marcela.fasta -db molluscan_genes/mollusca.rep.fa -evalue 1e-05 -num_threads 4 -out marcela.mollusca.rep.fa1e05 &
 


-BLASTing L. fortunei VASA protein JuAmerico found with the transcripts assembled from Trinity. Just to check. The protein is well conserved
but it looks like its missing 100aa at the beginning.

/data2/Marcela/scripts/ncbi-blast-2.4.0+/bin/tblastn -query vasa.lf.fa -db /data2/Marcela/data/rna-seq/trinti.1.2.3/Trinities.1.2.3.fasta -evalue 1e-05 -num_threads 4 -out vasa.trinity1.2.3.tblastn &
After that, I got all the trinity hits and translated them using transdecode, so we can check how similar to the genomic de novo preditec vasa the transcripts are:

perl /home/bioma/scripts/PASApipeline-2.0.2/pasa-plugins/transdecoder/transcripts_to_best_scoring_ORFs.pl -t vasa.trinity1.2.3.tblastn.cov.trinityID.fasta

-BLASTing L. fortunei (marcela.fasta) against C. elegans proteins selected by Ju (3979 seqs, sterile-phenoype).
makeblastdb -in c_elegans.PRJNA13758.WS258.protein.sterile.fa -dbtype prot

nohup blastp -query ../marcela.fasta -db /home/ubuntu/c_elegans/c_elegans.PRJNA13758.WS258.protein.sterile.fa -evalue 1e-05 -num_threads 4 -out marcela.c_elegans.PRJNA13758.WS258.protein.sterile.1e05 &

How to get a whole line by a list of IDs.

awk 'NR==FNR{tgts[$1]; next} $1 in tgts' file1 file2

Today I'll curate the possible VASA gene Ju found among the golden Mussel proteins. Which means I'll look into the scaffolds from 
where it was predicted, and see how much RNA-seq there is aligned to it.

So the first thing is to find which scaffold it is. And it is this:

L_FORTUNEI.itr6_4515

Then, you get all the rna-seq aligned to it in a bam file using samtools

samtools view -h all.merged.sorted.bam L_FORTUNEI.itr6_4515_ > L_FORTUNEI.itr6_4515_all.merged.sam

then
samtools view -Sb L_FORTUNEI.itr6_4515_all.merged.sam -o L_FORTUNEI.itr6_4515_all.merged.bam
